This code was developed on C for a RC car with sensors and motors, on a microcontroller with a Real Time Operating System. The freertos_hello file contains the main function that calls all 3 task setups that need to be ran for the RC Car to function. These task setups are contained in the LED_Component, Motor_Control _Component and RC_Receiver_Component source files. The RC_Receiver_Component receives values from a RC controller using UART and passes them into Queues which are sent to the Motor and LED tasks. The motor tasks controls the speed and direction of the RC car using PWM. The LED task is used to identify what speed the RC car is set to, Red, Green or Blue. The files included are the main files needed to run the car. ***Other header files for the board setup are not included due to size.
